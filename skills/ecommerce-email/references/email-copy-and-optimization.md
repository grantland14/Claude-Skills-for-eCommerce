## Product-Focused Copy

Email product descriptions should be shorter and more benefit-driven than product pages.

### Structure
- Product image (hero -- this does most of the work in email)
- 1-sentence benefit headline
- 2-3 sentence description focusing on outcome, not features
- Star rating + review snippet
- Price + CTA button

### Example Framework
```
[Product Image]

[Benefit Headline: "Wake up to brighter skin"]

[Brief description: "Our Vitamin C serum absorbs in seconds and delivers visible results in 14 days. 4,000+ five-star reviews can't be wrong."]

[Star Rating] "Best skincare purchase I've ever made" -- Sarah K.

## Urgency & Scarcity (Ethical Approach)

### Real urgency (use these)
- Genuine limited stock: "Only 47 left in stock"
- Real deadlines: "Sale ends Sunday at midnight"
- Shipping deadlines: "Order by Dec 18 for Christmas delivery"
- Expiring discount codes with real expiration dates
- Seasonal relevance: "Perfect for Mother's Day -- this Sunday"

### Fake urgency (avoid these)
- Invented countdown timers that reset
- "Almost sold out" when inventory is plentiful
- Perpetual "limited time" offers that never end
- Creating false scarcity when products are always available

---

## Social Proof in Emails

### Types to Use
- **Star ratings**: Show aggregate rating next to products
- **Review snippets**: Pull the best 1-2 sentence reviews
- **UGC photos**: Real customer photos beat studio shots for trust
- **Metrics**: "Sold [X,000] units" / "[X] five-star reviews"
- **Press mentions**: "Featured in [Publication]"
- **Influencer quotes**: Short endorsements with attribution

### Placement
Near CTAs and product images. Social proof reduces friction right at the decision point.

## Discount Strategy

| Tactic | When to Use | When to Avoid |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **% off** (10-20%) | Welcome series, win-back, BFCM | Abandoned cart (premium brands), loyal VIPs |
| **$ off** | Higher AOV products (sounds bigger: "$15 off" vs. "10% off") | Low AOV products where the $ amount seems small |
| **Free shipping** | Always worth testing -- often as effective as % off | When you already offer free shipping |
| **Gift with purchase** | Product launches, AOV boost, premium feel | When the gift has no perceived value |
| **Bundle discount** | AOV boost, cross-sell, subscription push | When bundles don't make sense for your products |
| **Tiered discount** | "Spend $50 save 10%, $100 save 15%, $150 save 20%" | When it overcomplicates the shopping experience |

### Rules
- Never discount more than your margins allow
- Don't train customers to wait for discounts (limit frequency)
- VIPs should get perks, not just discounts (early access, exclusivity, free shipping)
- Track discount-driven revenue vs. full-price revenue monthly

---

## Subject Line Formulas

### Patterns That Work for eCommerce

**Curiosity**: "[Name], we made something new" / "You haven't seen this yet"
**Urgency**: "Last 4 hours" / "Going fast -- [Product]" / "Final call"
**Personalization**: "[Name], these are for you" / "Based on your last order"
**Social proof**: "[X,000] sold this week" / "Our #1 bestseller"
**Question**: "Ready for your next [Product]?" / "Missing something?"
**Benefit**: "Smoother skin in 7 days" / "Your best sleep starts tonight"
**Specificity**: "The $32 moisturizer that replaces 3 products"

### What to Avoid
- ALL CAPS (spam trigger)
- Excessive emojis (1 max, test effectiveness)
- Misleading subject lines (damages trust and triggers spam filters)
- Generic ("Big sale!" "Don't miss out!")
- Too long (keep under 50 characters for mobile, 60 max)

### Preview Text Strategy
- Always customize (never leave as default "View in browser" text)
- Extend the subject line, don't repeat it
- Add specificity the subject line couldn't fit
- 90-140 characters

## Storytelling Structures for DTC

DTC brands have a storytelling advantage over big retail. Use it.

### Founder Story Email Structure
- The problem you experienced personally
- The "aha moment" that led to creating the product
- What makes your approach different
- Where you are now + customer impact
- CTA to try the product that started it all

### Behind-the-Scenes Email Structure
- Show a specific moment in the process (sourcing, manufacturing, testing)
- Explain why this step matters for quality
- Connect it to the customer benefit
- Quick CTA to shop

### Customer Story Email Structure
- Feature a real customer by name (with permission)
- Their before/after or transformation
- Include their photo and direct quote
- Show which products they use
- CTA to shop that product

---

## A/B Testing Strategy

### Highest-Impact Tests by Flow

| Flow | What to Test | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Abandoned Cart | First email delay (1hr vs. 4hr) | Timing heavily impacts recovery rate |
| Abandoned Cart | Discount vs. no discount (Email 3) | Margin impact vs. recovery rate |
| Welcome | Discount amount (10% vs. 15% vs. free shipping) | Balance conversion vs. margin |
| Welcome | Number of emails (5 vs. 7) | Find the point of diminishing returns |
| Post-Purchase | Cross-sell timing (14 days vs. 21 days) | Too early feels pushy |
| Win-Back | Trigger timing (90 days vs. 120 days) | Match your repurchase cycle |
| All Flows | Subject lines (always) | Highest-ROI test for any flow |

### Testing Rules
- Test one variable at a time
- Let tests run until statistically significant (Klaviyo shows significance)
- Minimum 1,000 recipients per variant for reliable results
- Document every test and result

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Klaviyo (Primary)

**Key features to leverage:**
- **Flows**: Visual flow builder with conditional splits, time delays, A/B testing
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predicted CLV, predicted next order date, churn risk score (use for segmentation and flow triggers)
- **Smart Sending**: Prevents over-messaging by enforcing minimum time between sends
- **Product Feeds**: Dynamic product blocks pulling from your Shopify/WooCommerce catalog
- **Segment Builder**: Powerful real-time segmentation using events, properties, and predictive data
- **A/B Testing in Flows**: Test subject lines, content, and timing within automated flows
- **Back in Stock & Price Drop**: Built-in flow triggers for inventory changes
- **Review Integrations**: Native integrations with Judge.me, Stamped, Yotpo, Okendo

**Klaviyo-specific tips:**
- Always use Smart Sending (16-hour minimum recommended)
- Build segments for campaign sending, not lists (segments are dynamic)
- Use Conditional Splits, not multiple flows, for branching logic
- Enable "Placed Order" as a flow filter on every revenue-driving flow
- Set up UTM tracking in Klaviyo settings for accurate attribution in Google Analytics

### Omnisend

**Key differences from Klaviyo:**
- Built-in SMS capabilities (no separate integration needed)
- Simpler interface, less flexible segmentation
- Good for brands that want email + SMS in one tool
- Pre-built automation templates for eCommerce flows
- Less powerful predictive analytics

**When to use**: Smaller brands ($0-$500K revenue) who want simplicity and built-in SMS. Migrate to Klaviyo when you need advanced segmentation and predictive analytics.

### Mailchimp

**Key differences from Klaviyo:**
- Customer Journey builder (their automation tool)
- Weaker eCommerce-specific features
- Less granular segmentation
- No native price drop or back-in-stock flows
- Limited product feed functionality

**When to use**: Very early stage brands on a tight budget. Migrate to Klaviyo or Omnisend when email becomes a serious revenue channel ($50K+ revenue and growing).

## Email Program Audit Framework

Use this checklist to audit an existing eCommerce email program and identify revenue leaks.

### Flow Audit Checklist

For each flow, check: Is it live? How many emails? Last updated? Performance vs. benchmarks?

- [ ] **Welcome Series**: Live? Has non-purchaser branch? Incentive delivery working? 5+ emails?
- [ ] **Abandoned Cart**: Live? 3+ emails? Dynamic cart content? Discount strategy defined?
- [ ] **Browse Abandonment**: Live? 2+ emails? Frequency capped?
- [ ] **Post-Purchase**: Live? Includes review request? Cross-sell? Replenishment?
- [ ] **Win-Back**: Live? Trigger timing aligned with repurchase cycle? Includes sunset?
- [ ] **Sunset**: Live? Protecting deliverability? Running continuously?
- [ ] **Back in Stock**: Live? "Notify Me" button on OOS product pages?
- [ ] **Price Drop**: Live or needed?
- [ ] **VIP Recognition**: Defined? Any VIP-specific flows or campaigns?
- [ ] **Birthday**: Collecting birthday data? Flow live?

### Revenue Audit

- [ ] Email revenue as % of total: Target 25-40%. Below 20% = major opportunity.
- [ ] Flow vs. campaign split: Flows should be 30-50%+ of email revenue
- [ ] Revenue per recipient by flow: Compare to benchmarks above
- [ ] Missing flows = missing revenue: Each missing flow is a revenue leak

### List Health Audit

- [ ] List growth rate: 5-10%/month is healthy
- [ ] Engagement distribution: What % is engaged (30-day)? Semi-engaged? Unengaged?
- [ ] Bounce rate: Below 0.5% is healthy, above 2% is a problem
- [ ] Spam complaint rate: Below 0.1% is required, above 0.08% is warning territory
- [ ] Unsubscribe rate: Below 0.3% per campaign is healthy

### Campaign Audit

- [ ] Sending frequency: Consistent? At least 1-2x/week for engaged segments?
- [ ] Content variety: Mix of promotional and content-driven?
- [ ] Segmentation: Sending to engagement segments, not full list?
- [ ] Seasonal calendar: Planned in advance? Covering major events?

### Gap Analysis Output

After auditing, organize findings as:
1. **Quick wins**: Missing flows that are easy to set up (browse abandonment, back in stock)
2. **High-impact improvements**: Underperforming flows that need optimization (weak abandoned cart, no post-purchase)
3. **Strategic gaps**: Missing capabilities (no segmentation, no VIP program, no content emails)
4. **Deliverability risks**: List hygiene issues, missing sunset, high complaints

## Advanced Tactics

### Zero-Party Data Collection

Collect customer preferences directly to improve personalization.

**Methods:**
- **Post-purchase survey email**: "What did you buy this for?" (self, gift, someone else)
- **Preference center**: Let subscribers choose email frequency, product categories, interests
- **Quiz flow**: Product recommendation quiz > capture responses > personalize future emails
- **Progressive profiling**: Collect one new data point per email interaction

**Klaviyo implementation**: Store responses as custom profile properties, then use them in flow conditional splits and campaign segmentation.

### SMS + Email Coordination

**When to use SMS vs. email:**
- **SMS**: Flash sales, shipping updates, time-sensitive offers, back in stock alerts, abandoned cart (complement email)
- **Email**: Brand storytelling, product education, detailed content, long-form campaigns

**Coordination rules:**
- Never send SMS and email for the same message at the same time
- Use SMS for urgency, email for detail
- Respect opt-in preferences separately
- Cap SMS at 4-6/month (higher frequency = higher unsubscribe)

**Klaviyo implementation**: Use SMS as a step within email flows. Example: Abandoned cart Email 1 (1 hour) > SMS (4 hours) > Email 2 (24 hours).

### Dynamic Product Recommendations

**Cross-sell logic:**
- "Customers who bought [Product A] also bought [Product B]"
- Based on complementary products (shampoo > conditioner, serum > moisturizer)
- Use Klaviyo's product feed with "Related Products" or "Trending" algorithms

**Upsell logic:**
- Recommend premium or larger versions of products they've bought
- Subscription upsell for consumable products
- Bundle recommendations to increase AOV

**Klaviyo implementation**: Use dynamic product blocks in flows with catalog data. Set recommendation logic per flow (e.g., post-purchase = cross-sell, browse abandonment = viewed products).

### Subscription & Replenishment

For brands selling consumable or repeat-purchase products:

**Replenishment timing by category:**
- Skincare: 30-45 days
- Supplements/vitamins: 25-30 days
- Coffee/tea: 14-21 days
- Pet food: 21-30 days
- Cleaning supplies: 30-45 days
- Baby products: 14-30 days

**Subscription push flow:**
- After 2nd purchase of same product: introduce subscribe-and-save option
- Highlight convenience + savings
- "Never run out of [Product] again -- save 15% with auto-ship"
