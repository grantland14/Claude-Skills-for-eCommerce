## Instagram Full Strategy

### Content Mix
- Reels: 3-5 per week (highest reach potential)
- Carousel posts: 2-3 per week (highest saves and shares)
- Stories: Daily (maintains visibility and builds intimacy)
- Feed posts (single image): 1-2 per week
- Live: Monthly or for special events (launches, Q&As)

### What Works on Instagram for eCommerce
- Reels showing the product in use (30-60 seconds, trending audio)
- Carousels with educational content (ingredient breakdowns, routines, comparisons)
- UGC reposts with added context in caption
- Aesthetic flatlay photography that matches the grid
- Stories with polls, questions, and behind-the-scenes
- Shopping tags on product images (link directly to PDP)

### Instagram Caption Structure
```
Hook (first line — this shows in the feed before "...more"):
[Attention-grabbing first line that makes them tap to expand]

Body (value or story):
[2-4 short paragraphs with line breaks]
[Include the key information, benefit, or story]

CTA:
[Tell them what to do: "Shop via link in bio" / "Save this for later" / "Tag someone who needs this"]

Hashtags:
[15-20 relevant hashtags — mix of broad and niche]
```

### Instagram Reels Hooks for eCommerce
- "The [product] that changed my [routine/morning/skin/etc.]"
- "Unboxing my favorite [brand]"
- "3 ways to use [product]"
- "Why I stopped using [common alternative] and switched to [product]"
- "What I order vs. what I get" (showing expectation vs. reality — product delivers)
- "Rating every product in my [routine]"
- "Products I'll never stop repurchasing"

---

## TikTok Full Strategy

### Content Mix
- 1-3 posts per day (TikTok rewards volume more than any other platform)
- Mix of brand-created and creator content
- Spark Ads to boost top-performing organic posts

### What Works on TikTok for eCommerce
- "TikTok made me buy it" style content
- POV videos (showing the product experience from the customer's perspective)
- Get Ready With Me (GRWM) featuring your products
- Green screen format with product page behind the creator
- "Things I wish I knew before buying [product category]"
- Side-by-side comparisons (your product vs. drugstore alternative)
- ASMR product content (unboxing, textures, application)
- Founder talking directly to camera about why they made the product

### TikTok Caption Style
Keep it short — 1-2 sentences max. The video does the talking.
```
[Punchy one-liner that adds context to the video]
#relevanthashtag #yourbrand #tiktokmademebuyit
```

### TikTok vs. Instagram Reels
- TikTok: Raw, unfiltered, personality-driven. More is more.
- Reels: Slightly more polished, grid-conscious, can be more curated.
- Don't cross-post with watermarks. Reshoot or re-edit for each platform.

## Pinterest Full Strategy

### Content Mix
- 5-15 pins per day (more is better on Pinterest — it's a search platform)
- Mix of product pins, lifestyle pins, and idea pins
- Optimize for search keywords, not trending audio

### What Works on Pinterest for eCommerce
- Product-on-white images with text overlay naming the product and key benefit
- Lifestyle images showing the product in a beautiful, aspirational setting
- Infographics (ingredient breakdowns, "how to use" guides, skincare routines)
- Gift guide pins ("Gifts for her under $50")
- Seasonal content published 2-3 months ahead of the season
- Video pins (unboxing, product demos, tutorials)

### Pinterest Copy Template
Pin titles should be descriptive and keyword-rich (Pinterest is a search engine):
```
Title: [Product Type] — [Key Benefit] | [Brand Name]
Description: [2-3 sentences with relevant keywords. Include what the product does, who it's for, and key features. Natural language, not keyword stuffing.]
```

## Facebook Best Uses Detail

Best uses for DTC brands on Facebook:
- Run a branded community group (customer community, not just a page)
- Share longer-form content (brand stories, founder messages)
- Cross-post important announcements from Instagram
- Use for retargeting ads (Facebook pixel data is valuable)
- Facebook Shop integration for in-platform browsing

## UGC & Creator Strategy

### Building a UGC Pipeline

**How to get UGC for free:**
- Add an insert to every order: "Share your [product] moment — tag us @[brand] for a chance to be featured"
- Repost every customer that tags you (this encourages more)
- Run a monthly "feature of the month" where the best UGC post gets a gift card
- Ask in post-purchase emails: "Love your [product]? Share a photo!"

**How to get UGC through creators:**
- Pay micro-creators ($50-200 per video) for usage rights
- Use TikTok Creator Marketplace or platforms like Billo, Insense, or Cohley
- Brief them clearly: product, talking points, hook, CTA, dos/don'ts
- Get usage rights so you can use the content as ads too

### Creator Brief Template

```
Brand: [Brand name]
Product: [What to feature]
Platform: [TikTok / Instagram / Both]
Format: [Talking head / GRWM / Unboxing / Routine]
Length: [15-60 seconds]

Hook (how to start the video):
"[Exact opening line or approach]"

Key talking points (pick 2-3):
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Differentiator]

CTA (how to end):
"[What to say — e.g., 'Link in bio' or 'I'll leave the link']"

Dos:
- Be natural, conversational
- Show the product in use
- Mention a specific result or benefit

Don'ts:
- Don't start with "Hey guys"
- Don't read from a script
- Don't show competitor products
```

## Measurement & Optimization

### Metrics That Matter for eCommerce Social

| Metric | Why It Matters | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Engagement rate | Algorithm signal + community health | 2-5% (Instagram), 4-8% (TikTok) |
| Saves | High-intent signal — they want to come back | 1-3% of impressions |
| Shares | Organic reach multiplier | 0.5-2% of impressions |
| Link clicks (bio) | Direct traffic to store | Track weekly trend |
| Follower growth rate | Brand awareness trajectory | 2-5% monthly for growing brands |
| Profile visits | Curiosity to consideration | Track weekly trend |
| Revenue from social (UTM tracked) | The metric that actually matters | Track monthly |

### Weekly Review Checklist

- Top 3 posts by engagement — what pattern do they share?
- Top 3 by reach — what got distribution?
- Any posts that flopped — what can you learn?
- Follower growth this week
- DMs and comments — common questions or themes
- Clicks to site from social (check Google Analytics with UTM source = social)

### What to Do When Engagement Drops

1. Check frequency — are you posting enough? Posting too much?
2. Check content mix — are you too promotional? Too same-y?
3. Check engagement habits — are you responding to every comment? Engaging with other accounts?
4. Test new formats — if carousels are stale, try Reels. If Reels plateau, try carousels.
5. Check timing — review when your audience is most active (platform insights)
6. Refresh your hooks — if the first line isn't stopping scrolls, nothing else matters
