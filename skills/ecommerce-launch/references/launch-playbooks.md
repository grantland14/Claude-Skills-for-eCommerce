## Launch-Specific Strategy Playbooks

### Waitlist Launch Playbook

Build a waitlist and reward early signups with exclusive access:

```
Waitlist tiers:
First 100 signups: 20% off launch price + free shipping
101-500 signups: 15% off launch price
501+: Early access (no discount, but shop before general public)
```

Show the counter: "847 people are waiting" — social proof drives more signups.

### Drop Model Playbook

Set a specific date and time. Build anticipation. Drop everything at once.

- Countdown timer on homepage for 7 days before
- Product details fully revealed 3 days before (no secrets — let desire build)
- "Set a reminder" option on the product page
- At drop time, email + SMS + social post simultaneously
- If inventory is truly limited, show live inventory count on the product page

### Soft Launch Playbook

Launch quietly to a small audience first. Gather data and feedback before full launch.

- **Week 1:** Email to VIP segment only (100-500 customers)
- **Week 2:** Open to full email list
- **Week 3:** Turn on paid ads
- **Week 4:** Full public launch with press and influencers

Benefits: You have reviews, optimized pages, and proven messaging before investing in paid acquisition.

### Pre-Order Launch Playbook

Accept orders before the product ships. Use when manufacturing timelines are long.

- Clearly state: "Pre-order — ships by [date]"
- Offer a pre-order incentive (10% off, free gift, exclusive variant)
- Send regular updates: "Your [product] is in production," "Shipping this week!"
- The waiting creates anticipation — use it. Behind-the-scenes content during the wait period builds excitement.
