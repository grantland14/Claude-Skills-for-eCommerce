## Area 1: Ad Creative Analysis (Meta Ad Library)

### What to Analyze

**Volume and activity:**
- How many active ads are running?
- Brands with 20+ active ads are likely spending significantly
- Brands with 5-10 ads are either small budget or very focused
- Look at "started running" dates to see creative refresh frequency

**Ad formats:**
- Static images vs. video vs. carousel
- Which format appears most often? (They've likely tested and this is what works)
- UGC-style content vs. professional photography
- Text overlays vs. clean imagery

**Messaging themes:**
- What problems are they highlighting?
- What benefits do they lead with?
- What emotional hooks are they using? (Fear, desire, aspiration, relief)
- What offers appear in the ads? (Discounts, free shipping, bundles, free trials)

**Creative patterns:**
- Before/after imagery
- Product close-ups vs. lifestyle
- Founder-facing video
- Customer testimonial clips
- Comparison content ("Why we're different")
- Educational or explainer content

**Hooks and headlines:**
- What stops the scroll? (First 3 seconds of video, headline on static)
- Common hook structures: question, statistic, bold claim, customer quote
- CTA patterns: "Shop now," "Try risk-free," "Get yours," "See why 10K customers switched"

**Offers:**
- What discount or incentive appears in the ads?
- Free shipping, percentage off, dollar off, gift with purchase, subscribe and save?
- Are offers consistent across all ads or varied by audience?

**Audience targeting signals:**
- Different ads for different audiences? (Variations suggest they're targeting multiple segments)
- Ads mentioning specific demographics? ("Made for busy moms," "For athletes over 40")
- Retargeting vs. prospecting creative? (Social proof ads are often retargeting)

## Area 4: Email and Retention Analysis

### How to Analyze a Competitor's Email Program

The best way to study a competitor's email program is to subscribe to their list yourself using a secondary email address. Over 2-4 weeks, screenshot and save everything you receive. Then share those emails with Claude for analysis.

If you've already been collecting competitor emails, share them here and Claude will analyze the strategy, timing, copy quality, and what you can learn from them.

### What to Look For

**Welcome series:**
- How many emails in the welcome sequence?
- Timing between emails?
- What's the welcome offer?
- Is there a non-purchaser branch (do they send different emails if you don't buy)?
- What story do they tell across the sequence?

**Browse abandonment:**
- After subscribing, visit a product page. Do you get browse abandonment emails?
- How soon after? (1 hour? 4 hours? 24 hours?)
- What's the message? (Reminder? Social proof? Incentive?)

**Cart abandonment:**
- Add a product to cart but don't check out. Do you get cart recovery emails?
- How many emails? What's the timing?
- Do they offer a discount in later emails?

**Ongoing campaigns:**
- How often do they send campaign emails? (Daily? 3x/week? Weekly?)
- What types of content? (Product promos, educational, storytelling, sales)
- What's the quality of their email design and copy?
